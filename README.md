To run this program Please first install JavaFX, I would have uploaded it but it was larger then 25mb.

Official Download link: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ , I downloaded the stable version 11.02

To Install JavaFX into IntelliJ follow this official guide: https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx

Or watch this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHj6zbH3inI

Then save the files Main and WavClient in src, make a folder called seperate and save the WavServer file ther


Open Terminal in Intellij to open the server

first cd into src

then compile WavClient and WavServer like this:

javac WavClient.java

javac seperate\\WavClient.java

Then open server:

java seperate/WavClient.java

(Feel free to look at my report with screenshots to view how to open server)

Now Run Main from the ide and you will be able to use my program!


To Download WAV Files to use with my program use this google drive link as WAV files were too big to upload: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DSudYdBekQbV-MVhhKQIjxU6VjXiCGQ3?usp=sharing
